      <h1>Clue #1</h1>
      <p> An insurance salesman walks up to a house and knocks on the door. A woman answers, and he asks her how many children she has and how old they are. She says I will give you a hint. If you multiply the 3 children’s ages, you get 36. He says this is not enough information. So she gives a him 2nd hint. If you add up the children’s ages, the sum is the number on the house next door. He goes next door and looks at the house number (13) and says this is still not enough information. So she says she’ll give him one last hint which is that her oldest of the 3 plays piano. Why would he need to go back to get the last hint after seeing the number on the house next door?</p>
